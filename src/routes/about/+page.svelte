	<p>
		As a long time Hurricane's fan, I have seeing Ovi blow one timers on my team countless times.
		Despite watching him beat my team throughout the years, it has been nothing short of incredible
		to see how many goals he has scored. As he has pushed closer to passing Gretzky, I wanted to
		create a fun little project to keep track of the number of goals scored until he surpasses the
		record.
